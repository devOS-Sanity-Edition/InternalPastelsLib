/**
 * This is an extremely vital class. This class is crucial for the correct functionality of
 * Inner Pastels. This is extremely important, and cannot be removed under any circumstances.
 * This class single-handedly holds together the Library. Without this class, everything
 * falls apart. This class is the reason humanity has not yet gone extinct. This class is
 * the only thing holding together the remains of the time-space continuum. Without this incredibly
 * crucial class, everything ever will fail catastrophically. In the event this class is removed,
 * expect you to go next, followed by the rest of humanity, and finally, all reality.
 * Once again, DO NOT REMOVE THIS CLASS.
